## Please read the context below before submitting a bug report

The issue tracker is reserved to tracking bugs, reproducible in the context described in the
"Context" section.

Installation and configuration issues are not bugs, but individual assistance request.

Context: the LATEST version of `dnscrypt-proxy` (precompiled binaries downloaded from this
repository) is correctly installed and configured on your system, but something doesn't
seem to produce the expected result.

If the bug is not trivial to reproduce on any platform, please include ALL the steps required
to reliably duplicate it, on a vanilla, generic install of macOS, Windows, OpenBSD or Ubuntu Linux
system, in their most current version.
