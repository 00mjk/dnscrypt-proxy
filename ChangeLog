 - Cached source data were not redownloaded if the proxy was used
without interruption. This has been fixed.
 - RTT estimation for DNS-over-HTTP/2 servers was off. This has been
fixed.
 - The generate-domains-blacklist script now has a configurable
timeout value, and can produce time-based rules.
 - The timeout parameter in the example configuration file didn't had
the correct name; this has been fixed.
 - Cache: TTLs are now decreasing.
