* Version 2.0.4
 - Fixes a regression with truncated packets. Thanks to @mazesy and
@the-w1nd for spotting a case triggering this!

* Version 2.0.3
 - Load balancing: resolvers that respond promptly, but with bogus
responses are now gradually removed from the preferred pool.
 - Due to popular request, Android binaries are now available! Thanks
to @sporif for his help on getting these built.
 - Binaries are built using Go 1.10-final.

* Version 2.0.2
 - Properly error out on FreeBSD and other platforms where built-in
service installation is not supported yet.
 - Improved load-balancing algorithm, which should result in lower
latency.

* Version 2.0.1
 - Cached source data were not redownloaded if the proxy was used
without interruption. This has been fixed.
 - If the network is down at startup time, fall back to cached source
data, even if is it out of date, and schedule an immediate update
after the networks is back.
 - RTT estimation for DNS-over-HTTP/2 servers was off. This has been
fixed.
 - The generate-domains-blacklist script now has a configurable
timeout value, and can produce time-based rules.
 - The timeout parameter in the example configuration file didn't had
the correct name; this has been fixed.
 - Cache: TTLs are now decreasing.
